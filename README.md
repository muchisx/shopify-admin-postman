# How to use in your Workspace?

For using it in your own Workspace you have multiple options.

These Collections [are using Collection Variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/), make sure to fill all the variables that you will use before launching requests!

## Option A. You can use it from the Web View Collections linked above.

The variables that you define under the `Current value` input are stored only in your account, so you can safely use it from there.

> This will only work for the REST APIs for now, due to Postman only allowing GraphQL queries in the Desktop client.

## Option A-2. You can use it from the Desktop View.

The variables that you define under the `Current value` input are stored only in your account, so you can safely use it from there.

## Option B. [Fork it directly](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/) from the Web View collections linked above.

This should allow you to fork it directly into your Workspace.

> This will only work for the REST APIs for now, due to Postman only allowing GraphQL queries in the Desktop client.

## Option C. [Import it directly](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/) from this github repository.

> This will only work for importing the REST APIs for now, due to a Postman bug I haven't been able to export the GraphQL ones to add it here.

Go through the import process and it should automatically add it to your workspace.

## Option D. Manually download the collection files and import into Postman.

> This will only work for importing the REST APIs for now, due to a Postman bug I haven't been able to export the GraphQL ones to add it here.

The Postman Collection file is a JSON containing all information about each request.

Open Postman and import one of the files [from this folder:](/Postman%20Collections/)

- `Shopify Admin - REST.postman_collection.json`

# Where are my API Credentials?

In order to retrieve or create your private API Credentials, follow this link:

https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/auth/admin-app-access-tokens

# Recommended GraphQL client for first-time users.

If you're a first-time GraphQL user and just want to make mock requests to a store. I recommend you to start [here](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/getting-started-with-graphql).
In short, install the [GraphQL Shopify App](https://shopify-graphiql-app.shopifycloud.com/login?itcat=partner_blog&itterm=getting_started_with_graphql) in your store and do requests from there so you can learn the shape of the queries.

Alternatively, you can use Postman's GraphQL client in the Desktop version.
